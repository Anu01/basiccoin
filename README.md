BasicCoin
=============

This software is no longer being developed. It is not secure.
I am working on this other blockchain now: https://github.com/BumblebeeBat/FlyingFox

A very small POW blockchain

=====INSTALL 

    sudo pip2 install m3-cdecimal #for Mac use pip instead of pip2
    sudo pip install leveldb
    #software can run without cdecimal, but it is slower.
    git clone https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/basiccoin.git
    cd basiccoin

====RUN A NODE

    python2.7 cli.py start

It will take time to download the blockchain.

====TALK TO THE NODE
